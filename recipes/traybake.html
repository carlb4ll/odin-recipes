    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      This easy chicken traybake is perfect for a midweek family dinner. Chicken
      pieces and colourful sweet potatoes, red onions and broccoli are simply
      roasted with herbs, paprika and lemon. Adding stock ensures everything is
      beautifully tender and there’s a little gravy left in the bottom to serve
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>500g sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into 2cm chunks</li>
      <li>2 red onions, cut into wedges</li>
      <li>350g broccoli, broken into florets</li>
      <li>8 garlic cloves, unpeeled</li>
      <li>2 tsp dried thyme</li>
      <li>1 tsp dried rosemary</li>
      <li>1½ tbsp olive oil</li>
      <li>6 skinless chicken thigh fillets, each cut in half</li>
      <li>2 lemons, 1 juiced and 1 cut into wedges to serve</li>
      <li>1 tsp smoked paprika</li>
      <li>150ml chicken stock</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to gas 6, 200°C, fan 180°C. Add the sweet potatoes,
        onions, broccoli and garlic to a large roasting tray and sprinkle over
        the dried herbs. Season and drizzle over 1 tbsp of the oil, then toss
        everything together. Spread the veg out in an even layer and roast for
        15 mins.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the tray from the oven and give the veg a good mix. Add the
        chicken pieces and drizzle with the remaining ½ tbsp oil. Squeeze over
        the lemon juice and sprinkle with the paprika. Return to the oven for 15
        mins.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour over most of the chicken stock, then roast for a final 15-20 mins
        (topping up with a little more stock if it starts to look too dry) until
        the chicken is cooked through and the veg is completely tender. Squeeze
        the garlic cloves from their skins and serve with lemon wedges.
      </li>
