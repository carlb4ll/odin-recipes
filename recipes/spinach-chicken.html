    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Perfect for a midweek dinner; cook your chicken breasts until tender in a
      thick, creamy sauce. Adding fresh baby spinach and zingy lemon juice will
      help you cut through the richness, not-to-mention it’s the ideal way to up
      the flavour! This healthy option is sure to please the whole family.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        100g drained sundried tomatoes, sliced lengthways, plus 1 tbsp oil from
        the jar
      </li>
      <li>2 x 300g packs chicken breast fillets</li>
      <li>5 tsp cornflour</li>
      <li>1 red onion, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>3 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
      <li>½ chicken stock cube, made up to 100ml</li>
      <li>250g pack baby spinach</li>
      <li>½ lemon, juiced</li>
      <li>150ml single cream</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Put the sundried tomatoes in a small, heatproof bowl and cover with
        200ml boiling water; set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lay the chicken breasts between 2 pieces of clingfilm and use a rolling
        pin to gently bash the thickest parts to flatten them a little, so the
        breasts are an even thickness. Season with salt and lightly coat with 4
        tsp cornflour. Heat the sundried tomato oil in a large, deep, lidded
        frying pan over a medium-high heat, then fry the chicken breasts,
        without turning, for 4-6 mins each side until golden and cooked through.
        Transfer to a plate and cover to keep warm.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reduce the heat to medium-low, add the onion and garlic and cook for 10
        mins, stirring occasionally, until softened; add a splash of water if it
        starts to catch. Add the stock and sundried tomatoes; simmer for 1 min.
        Add the spinach, cover and cook for 2 mins, then remove the lid and stir
        well.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix 1 tsp cornflour with 2 tbsp water in a small bowl. Stir the
        cornflour mixture, lemon juice and cream into the pan and simmer for 2
        mins until thickened. Return the chicken to the pan, cover and cook for
        2-3 mins more until the chicken is warmed through, then serve.
