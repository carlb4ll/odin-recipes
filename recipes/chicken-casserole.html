    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>¾ cup heavy whipping cream</li>
      <li>½ cup (4 oz.) cream cheese</li>
      <li>3 tbsp green pesto</li>
      <li>1 tbsp lemon juice</li>
      <li>salt and pepper</li>
      <li>1½ oz. butter</li>
      <li>
        2 lbs skinless boneless chicken thighs, cut into bite-sized pieces
      </li>
      <li>6 oz. leeks, finely chopped</li>
      <li>4 oz. cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
      <li>¾ lb cauliflower, cut into small florets</li>
      <li>2 cups (8 oz.) cheddar cheese, shredded</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Mix cream and cream cheese with pesto and lemon juice. Salt and pepper
        to taste.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large pan over medium-high heat, melt the butter. Add the chicken,
        season with salt and pepper, and fry until they turn a nice golden
        brown.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the chicken in a greased 9 x 13" (23 x 33 cm) baking dish, and
        pour in the cream mixture.
      </li>
      <li>Top chicken with leek, tomatoes, and cauliflower.</li>
      <li>
        Sprinkle cheese on top and bake in the middle of the oven for at least
        30 minutes or until the chicken is fully cooked. If the casserole is at
        risk of burning before it's done, cover it with a piece of aluminium
        foil, lower the heat and let cook for a little longer.
